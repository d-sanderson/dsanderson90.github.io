				<p>My first photo is a rock-climber dressed for an interview. In the photo he is just starting to climb a
					rock wall. This is where I am right now. I have had 3
					careers over the past 5 years and here I am again starting to climb the rock wall. In the past I was
					picking jobs for the wrong reasons choosing money and foregoing my interests and drives. I have finally
					found a path that I am passionate and stimulated by so hopefully this will be my last time having to
					start from the bottom of the rock wall.
					My second photo is of an eagle soaring. In three years that will be me looking down at all I have
					learned.</p>

					<h2><strong>Weekly Reflections</strong></h2>


					<div id="week1reflection">
						<h3><strong>Week 1 Reflection:</strong></h3>
						<p>Holy ****, What an exciting first week! It's been a whirlwind but it feels amazing to be here. We
							covered
							quite a bit this week - ranging from basic HTML, git repos, server deployment, to data design and
							more. I
							now feel
							comfortable throwing up basic HTML websites to the server and laughing at how they looks like they
							are
							from the 90's. I can't wait to get better at CSS and Javascript so I can bring my sites into the
							modern
							age.
							On
							Wednesday I went to the React505 meetup and was blown away by the technology. It made me even more
							exited
							to
							learn
							Javascript! I love how responsive React is and how if you break something, it is immediately
							reflected
							on
							the browser without a refresh. Also learning about the virtual DOM was super fascinating. This week
							has
							been
							both challenging and inspiring. I know I have a lot to learn and that the weeks ahead will be
							arduous
							but
							my hopes balance out the stress and trepidations. I can't wait to learn more!
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="week2reflection">
						<h3><strong>Week 2 Reflection:</strong></h3>
						<p>Another week down! This week was filled with lots of ups and downs. Programming is a puzzle and the
							process
							is just as enjoyable as the product. Each day I am immersed in a language that I don't understand
							confronted by
							concepts that are equally perplexing. It's hard that for sure but damn if it isn't rewarding. I
							have
							found that I
							enjoy making something new and the anticipation I experience when I test it. Will it work or will
							it
							throw me a bunch of errors?
							Either way I will persist. I relish in the debugging as much I like building something new. What
							piece
							isn't working?
							Is there a flaw in my logic? What do I need to know to make this work? Even if I can get one piece
							to
							work
							I'll be one step closer to solving the larger problem. Some of the concepts we learned this week
							included Object Orient programming
							using PHP and Javascript. The data design project kicked my ass a bit but things are starting to
							fall
							into place. I am beginning to
							understand Clasess and how constructors make it easier to assign values(states) to our objects. I
							also
							had an aha moment when I read
							that Classes live in a lib file and that the can be exported and imported into the file in which we
							work with them. It was also really
							cool to see that a long snipper of code can be packaged into one variable and then executed. I look
							forward to what I will learn
							next week.

					<div id="passionproject">
						<h3><strong>Passion Project</strong></h3>
						<p>I started teaching myself how to play Piano 4 years ago. I've always been a musical person
							but told myself that it was too late in my life to learn an instrument. When my desire to create
							finally
							overcame my doubts, I got on craigslist and found myself a basic keyboard and practicing for an
							hour
							each
							day.
							I really wanted to be able to play my favorites songs and some idical music that I had heard
							growing
							up
							with my Dad. I made a lot of progress in the first year and often would go over my scheduled hour
							of
							practice
							just because I was enjoying learning. Eventually I bought a sweet Yamaha Electronic Keyboard with
							weighted
							keys. I love playing music because it brings me into a focused state where all of my worries and
							doubts
							sort of
							fade to the background. I love being so absorbed in a task that I cannot think of the past or
							future.
							It is interesting because in a flow state your mind is both relaxed and engaged in the task at
							hand. I
							continue
							to pratice piano and love learning new songs.
