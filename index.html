		<div class="PassionProject">
			<h4>Passion Project</h4>
			<p>I started teaching myself how to play Piano 4 years ago. I've always been a musical person
				but told myself that it was too late in my life to learn an instrument. When my desire to create finally
				overcame my doubts, I got on craigslist and bought a basic keyboard. I started teaching myself
				and practicing for an hour each day. I really wanted to be able to play my favorites songs from Zelda and
				Donkey Kong and some classical music that I had heard growing up with my Dad. I made a lot of progress and
				often would go over my scheduled hour of practice just because I was enjoying myself. Eventually I bought a sweet
				Yamaha Electronic Keyboard that had weighted keys and a beautiful sound. When I practiced for over an hour,
				I would enter a focused state and all of my worries and doubts would sort of fade away. I was brought into a
				pleasant flow state where I could be creative and relaxed. This drove me to continue my practice.

			<h5><strong>Week 1 Reflection:</strong> </h5>
			<p>Holy Shit, What an exciting first week! It's been a whirlwind but it feels amazing to be here. We covered
				quite a bit this week - ranging from basic HTML, git repos, server deployment, to data design and more. I now feel
				comfortable throwing up basic HTML websites to the server and laughing at how they looks like they are
				from the 90's. I can't wait to get better at CSS and Javascript so I can bring my sites into the modern age. On
				Wednesday I went to the React505 meetup and was blown away by the technology. It made me even more exited to learn
				Javascript! I love how the responsive React is and how if you break something, it is immediately reflected on
				the browser without a refresh. Also learning about the virtual DOM was super fascinating. This week has been
				both challenging and inspiring. I know I have a lot to learn and that the weeks ahead will be arduous but
				my hopes balance out the stress and trepidations. I can't wait to learn more!
