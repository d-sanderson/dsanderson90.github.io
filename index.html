					<h2>Visuals Speak</h2>
				<p>My first photo is a rock-climber dressed for an interview. In the photo he is just starting to climb a rock wall. This is where I am right now. I have had 3
				careers over the past 5 years but I was picking jobs for the wrong reasons choosing money and foregoing my interests and drives. I have finally found a path that I am passionate and stimulated by so hopefully this will be my last time having to start from the bottom of the rock wall.
				My second photo is of an eagle soaring. In three years that will be me looking down at all I have learned</p>

					<h3><strong>Week 1 Reflection:</strong></h3>
					<p>Holy ****, What an exciting first week! It's been a whirlwind but it feels amazing to be here. We
						covered
						quite a bit this week - ranging from basic HTML, git repos, server deployment, to data design and
						more. I
						now feel
						comfortable throwing up basic HTML websites to the server and laughing at how they looks like they are
						from the 90's. I can't wait to get better at CSS and Javascript so I can bring my sites into the
						modern
						age.
						On
						Wednesday I went to the React505 meetup and was blown away by the technology. It made me even more
						exited
						to
						learn
						Javascript! I love how responsive React is and how if you break something, it is immediately
						reflected
						on
						the browser without a refresh. Also learning about the virtual DOM was super fascinating. This week
						has
						been
						both challenging and inspiring. I know I have a lot to learn and that the weeks ahead will be arduous
						but
						my hopes balance out the stress and trepidations. I can't wait to learn more!
					</p>

				<div id="passionproject">
					<h3><strong>Passion Project</strong></h3>
					<p>I started teaching myself how to play Piano 4 years ago. I've always been a musical person
						but told myself that it was too late in my life to learn an instrument. When my desire to create
						finally
						overcame my doubts, I got on craigslist and found myself a basic keyboard and practicing for an hour
						each
						day.
						I really wanted to be able to play my favorites songs and some idical music that I had heard
						growing
						up
						with my Dad. I made a lot of progress in the first year and often would go over my scheduled hour of
						practice
						just because I was enjoying learning. Eventually I bought a sweet Yamaha Electronic Keyboard with
						weighted
						keys. I love playing music because it brings me into a focused state where all of my worries and
						doubts
						sort of
						fade to the background. I love being so absorbed in a task that I cannot think of the past or future.
						It is interesting because in a flow state your mind is both relaxed and engaged in the task at hand. I
						continue
						to pratice piano and love learning new songs.
