			<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I am determined and stubborn. Once I sink my teeth into a task I become obsessed and will not walk away
					until I am satisfied. Sometimes this leads to exhaustion and frustration.
				</li>
				<li>I am a good leader. I am fair and compassionate and take time to understand other peoples ideas and
					perspectives. I like to collaborate and enjoy getting all the right <br>
					people in the room to work on a project and assign everyone according to their strengths. Sometimes
					others
					may not like my desire or direction of my leadership
				</li>

			<div class="PassionProject">
				<h4>Passion Project</h4>
				<p>I started teaching myself how to play Piano 4 years ago. I've always been a musical person and wanted to
					play
					an instrument but told myself that it was too late in my life to learn.
					I bought a cheap keyboard off of craigslist and started practicing each day. I really wanted to be able
					to
					play
					my favorites songs from Zelda and Donkey Kong and some classical music
					that I had heard growing up with my Dad. I made a lot of progress and often would go over my scheduled
					hour
					of
					practice just because I was enjoying myself. Eventually I bought a sweet
					Yamaha Electronic Keyboard that had weighted keys and a beautiful sound. When I practiced for over an
					hour,
					I
					noticed all of my worries and doubts would sort of fade away. I was
					brought into a pleasant flow state where I could be creative and relaxed. This drove me to continue my
					practice.
