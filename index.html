					Hi my name is David Sanderson. I am a Full-stack Web developer. I use web technologies like
					Angular, JS, PHP, and Bootstrap to create custom web solutions. My favorite thing about coding is that
					you can use it to solve problems and build whatever you want! I want to use my coding skills to strengthen my community and get others
					into learning how to code. What can we build together to strengthen our community?

My favorite thing about coding is that you can use it to solve problems and build whatever you want! I want to use my coding skills to strengthen my community and get others into learning how to code. What can we build together in our community? I am an enthusiastic learner who excels in environments where I can problem solve and contribute to a team. Recently I build a madlib generator for my portfolio which familiarized me with array manipulation and taught me how to randomly select elements from arrays. I was on the dev team for 505FoodTruckFinder which was a contestant in the UNM App contest. I worked intensively on the Google Maps Javascript API integration during this project and learned how to get a user's location, store it in a DB and send it back to our front end. I am currently learned React and MongoDB in my free time.</p>

			<p>My first photo is a rock-climber dressed for an interview. In the photo he is just starting to climb a rock
				wall. This is where I am right now. I have had 3 careers over the past 5 years and here I am again starting
				to climb the rock wall. In the past I was picking jobs for the wrong reasons choosing money and foregoing my
				interests and drives. I have finally found a path that I am passionate and stimulated by so hopefully this
				will be my last time having to start from the bottom of the rock wall. My second photo is of an eagle
				soaring. In three years that will be me looking down at all I have learned.</p>

			<h2><strong>Weekly Reflections</strong></h2>


			<div id="week1reflection">
				<h3><strong>Week 1 Reflection:</strong></h3>
				<p>Holy ****, What an exciting first week! It's been a whirlwind but it feels amazing to be here. We covered
					quite a bit this week - ranging from basic HTML, git repos, server deployment, to data design and more. I
					now feel comfortable throwing up basic HTML websites to the server and laughing at how they looks like
					they are from the 90's. I can't wait to get better at CSS and Javascript so I can bring my sites into the
					modern age. On Wednesday I went to the React505 meetup and was blown away by the technology. It made me
					even more exited to learn Javascript! I love how responsive React is and how if you break something, it
					is immediately reflected on the browser without a refresh. Also learning about the virtual DOM was super
					fascinating. This week has been both challenging and inspiring. I know I have a lot to learn and that the
					weeks ahead will be arduous but my hopes balance out the stress and trepidations. I can't wait to learn
					more!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="week2reflection">
				<h3><strong>Week 2 Reflection:</strong></h3>
				<p>Another week down! This week was filled with lots of ups and downs. Programming is a puzzle and the
					process is just as enjoyable as the product. Each day I am immersed in a language that I don't understand
					confronted by concepts that are equally perplexing. It's hard that for sure but damn if it isn't
					rewarding. I have found that I enjoy making something new and the anticipation I experience when I test
					it. Will it work or will it throw me a bunch of errors? Either way I will persist. I relish in the
					debugging as much I like building something new. What piece isn't working? Is there a flaw in my logic?
					What do I need to know to make this work? Even if I can get one piece to work I'll be one step closer to
					solving the larger problem. Some of the concepts we learned this week included Object Orient programming
					using PHP and Javascript. The data design project kicked my ass a bit but things are starting to ffall
					into place. I am beginning to understand Clasess and how constructors make it easier to assign
					values(states) to our objects. I also had an aha moment when I read that Classes live in a lib file and
					that the can be exported and imported into the file in which we work with them. It was also really cool
					to see that a long snipper of code can be packaged into one variable and then executed. I look forward to
					what I will learn next week.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="week3reflection">
				<h3><strong>Week 3 Reflection:</strong></h3>
				<p>Reflections log stardate October 26th, 2018. We encountered several alien concepts this week. Some of
					them included CSS and a lecture about abstract classes in PHP. These concepts were fascinating and
					caused my brain to consume high amounts of glucose. Fortunately, the mess hall provided me with adequate
					nourishment. I really enjoyed working on the CSS challenge and found it to be a well-designed . This
					assignment gradually teaches you handy CSS selectors and properties. After completing
					the formatting, I feel confident about styling my Personal Website. I spent quite a bit of time
					reading MDN this week. One concept I found interesting was about prototypal inheritance in Javascript.
					Objects/Classes can inherit methods and states from their parent class so you don't have to rewrite
					the same code when you create a new class. The prototype chain will point to the parent class so the
					child class will inherit its properties and the code will remain DRY. I also read about how you
					can insert new methods into a class and that instantiated objects will dynamically get access to those
					new methods. Cool Right?! </p>
			</div>

			<div id="week4reflection">
				<h3><strong>Week 4 Reflection:</strong></h3>
				<p>1 Month down. We are close to half-way through (time flies when there is a fire hose of information
					blasting your brain). This week we broke out into our capstone teams and completed our personas and began
					data-design for our
					projects. I have had bouts of uncertainty about completing all the features we want in our project but I
					trust my team and feel
					confident that we will be able to make it happen. I am looking forward to becoming more familiar
					with the php and what is needed to have a functional backend for this project. I want to tackle the front
					end and learn how to glue JS to PHP to MYSQL. I have continued practicing Javascript after hours and am
					excited to build each piece of this project.

			<h3>Informational Interview: Javonne </h3>
			<h5>Occupation: </h5>

			<h2>Salary Expectation/Potential </h2>
			<p>As an entry level Web Developer I expect to make a less than or equal to 40k annually. According to
				Payscale.com's Salary Report, I will make anywhere between 38-54k/year with less than 1 year experience.
				In Albuquerque's job market I think I'll more likely start between 30-40k/year. I plan to build out my
				portfolio
				after bootcamp with projects that I will make me more attractive to local employers. Post bootcamp,
				I will be open to internships that pay less than this range so that I can get a foot in the door and gain
				industry experience. I do still have to pay rent and feed myself so I would not be able to take an unpaid
				internship.</p>

				<h3><strong>Passion Project</strong></h3>
				<p>I started teaching myself how to play Piano 4 years ago. I've always been a musical person but told
					myself that it was too late in my life to learn an instrument. When my desire to create finally
					overcame my doubts, I got on craigslist and found myself a basic keyboard and practicing for an hour
					each day. I really wanted to be able to play my favorites songs and some idical music that I had heard
					growing up with my Dad. I made a lot of progress in the first year and often would go over my
					scheduled hour of practice just because I was enjoying learning. Eventually I bought a sweet Yamaha
					Electronic Keyboard with weighted keys. I love playing music because it brings me into a focused state
					where all of my worries and doubts sort of fade to the background. I love being so absorbed in a task
					that I cannot think of the past or future. It is interesting because in a flow state your mind is both
					relaxed and engaged in the task at hand. I continue to pratice piano and love learning new songs.

			<div id="collaboration">
				<h3><strong>Forbidden Island Reflection</strong></h3>
				<p>
					Forbidden island was a useful exercise in collaboration. We spent half the time allotment figuring out
					game set up/how to play and got 2/4 treasures. Playing through the game revealed that I like to be have
					some degree of
					control of the direction of the team. If no one steps up to the lead role I am happy to take this
					position but I prefer to be 2nd in command and encourage a diplomatic decision-making process. This
					exercise is valuable in that it shows us how we will work together as a team. One challenge I think we
					will encounter is disagreement over the solution to problems. There will be multiple solutions but which
					one is the best?
