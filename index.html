					<h2><strong>Week 1 Reflection:</strong></h2>
					<p>Holy ****, What an exciting first week! It's been a whirlwind but it feels amazing to be here. We
						covered
						quite a bit this week - ranging from basic HTML, git repos, server deployment, to data design and
						more. I
						now feel
						comfortable throwing up basic HTML websites to the server and laughing at how they looks like they are
						from the 90's. I can't wait to get better at CSS and Javascript so I can bring my sites into the
						modern
						age.
						On
						Wednesday I went to the React505 meetup and was blown away by the technology. It made me even more
						exited
						to
						learn
						Javascript! I love how responsive React is and how if you break something, it is immediately
						reflected
						on
						the browser without a refresh. Also learning about the virtual DOM was super fascinating. This week
						has
						been
						both challenging and inspiring. I know I have a lot to learn and that the weeks ahead will be arduous
						but
						my hopes balance out the stress and trepidations. I can't wait to learn more!

					<h2><strong>Passion Project</strong></h2>
					<p>I started teaching myself how to play Piano 4 years ago. I've always been a musical person
						but told myself that it was too late in my life to learn an instrument. When my desire to create
						finally
						overcame my doubts, I got on craigslist and found myself a basic keyboard and practicing for an hour
						each
						day.
						I really wanted to be able to play my favorites songs and some classical music that I had heard
						growing
						up
						with my Dad. I made a lot of progress in the first year and often would go over my scheduled hour of
						practice
						just because I was enjoying learning. Eventually I bought a sweet Yamaha Electronic Keyboard with
						weighted
						keys. I love playing music because it brings me into a focused state where all of my worries and
						doubts
						sort of
						fade to the background. I love being so absorbed in a task that I cannot think of the past or future.
						It is interesting because in a flow state your mind is both relaxed and engaged in the task at hand. I
						continue
						to pratice piano and love learning new songs.
